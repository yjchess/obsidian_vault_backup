Hi - just started playing this game about a month ago - got to about Shinryu am v bad though haha. Had some questions though:

1. df3 > b3 > RDS2 > RDS.f3+4,3+4 > RDS.2 > RDS.2,2 > RDS.4 So I learned this combo but it sometimes drops and is inconsistent. I've since been advised that I should just learn a more consistent combo (of which I have df3 -> b3 -> RDS 2 -> RDS 2 -> RDS 2 -> RDS 1,2 - I also haave df3 -> b2, 2 -> 1, , RDS 1, 2). However when playing w friends I pulled out the inconsistent combo just to see what would happen and it worked like 60 percent of the time. Is there a way I can tell if the combo will work or if it drops after RDS2? I know that it seems to work 100% of the time if I get a df3 at the start of the game but ofc this will be harder/impossible for me to do when I fight higher level players. I just want to know if I can tell if it will work or not though. Honestly if it's 60% success rate, maybe I should just use it since it's a lot more damage? like I haven't done the maths but it seems to be worth it? idk. Or maybe there's better combos than the ones I've listed.
    

(Subquestion are these the same combos I should be using for RDS d4 ?)

2. What is the optimal ground break / balcony break combo for xiaoyu? (With and without heat)

3. How can I tell if what I'm learning is the optimal combo or not? I have been advised to use plings videos but even then I had to adapt one of their combos to be more consistent as otherwise it may drop earlier on depending on axis alignment: b1+2 df2 f2 f31 RDS 12 dash uf4D ws4 - I ended up removing the f2. Is there a place where I can go to find all the most optimal combos and the notes about them? like how to make them more consistent, how to know if it will work given a more inconsistent variation etc.

4. Should I always opt to use heat in my combos when I can?

5. Can someone explain how to maximise XiaoYu's wall combos a bit more to me? I've heard she's incredibly strong at the wall but rn all I know of wall combos is I splat them with a launcher into the wall and then if I have heat I do heat then f2,1 2 and if i don't I do f2,1 b2. Is there a recommended video for me to watch? How do I ensure I watch the optimal videos / resources?

6. Whats the quickest move out of RDS? Sometimes I like to do df3 b to cancel and do a move, but I keep finding that I am too slow sometimes even against opponents that guard low. Also regarding this, is there a quick way I can filter moves so that I can find the quickest move out of a stance? I know there's sites that documents frames and stuff of moves, but I'm not sure if there's one where it's super easy to filter stuff to find what you're looking for? Would also be helpful to filter for stuff like high crush or low crush.

7. How do I know when I should be using XiaoYu's spin? Also is it a bad idea to spin and then use my heat smash? As isn't that telegraphing it a little? i.e. should I enter it in a different way? i.e. 2,1?

8. Where can I find the best / optimal resources? Any video recommendations for a noob like me? I currently watch Silantro, Pling and Mr Croft

9. Are there any moves I should avoid? And alternatively are there moves I should aim to use as much as possible? Are there any small nuances I should know such as shoudl I use 1d2 more than f1+2 because it enters hyp?

10. what is the combo after RDS f3+4, 3+4? I tend to spam RDS f3+4, 3+4 (3times for my combo - but I'm sure there's probs a better continuation?)

11. Should I use an alternative to d1 as my keep out move?

12. (Regarding what I should practice next) When should I think about learning more specific matchup information and doing drills etc.? I been spending a long time learning XiaoYu and am still lacking in a tonne of areas. I'm missing some key combos, don't know how to dance, parry well dont know best time to use f, f3+4, don't know how to hit ws4 consistently, don't know when and how to use evasion moves properly etc. I also need to look more into my while standing punishes and continuations and strings and also ensure I get my confirmable extensions after I hit a move. There's so much idek where to begin. Not to mention I need to brush up on a lot of my fundamentals

13. Regarding RDS, I notice that a lot of the time RDS 1, 1,2 and stuff like that is easily punishable, should I be doing something instead? is there a safer option? I guess I should only do stuff like that if one of the hits lands.

14. what's the optimal low parry combo?

15. oh also sometimes in games I start w ssr aop 1,2 but sometimes it doesn't connect because the opp. will have moved past me. If the opp. has moved past me is there a way I can realign?
