MORNING CROW:

Devil Jin has a strong uf1 (can also be accessed via u1) (Infernal Shackle) which once hit causes an automatic morning crow (f3) and the following possibilities:

Tiger Thrush: 1
This is the move where dvj flies at you and makes a red bottom semicircle

Answer: If you get a read that Tiger Thrush is coming: whilst DvJ is in morning crow do: b1b float, ff3, d3 4, microdash, ub3, ufn3, dash uf2 1+2. However, be aware that dvj can mixup with dark arachnid twister (2,2) which will cause you to take damage instead.

The safer option would be to simply block and lose your turn (-7). Be aware that dvj may choose to grab right afterwards and be prepared for a 1+2 break. Blocking will help if dvj does Dark Arachnid Twister instead of Tiger Thrush 


Dark Arachnid Twister: 2 2

This is the move where dvj flies towards you and does two fast mids one tracking and the other not tracking.
Answer: block all moves and then do: ws4, ff3, d3 4, microdash, ub3, ufn3, dash uf2 1+2

Venomous Torment: 3
This is the move where dvj does a ground pound.
Answer: It is possible to visually confirm this move is happening and then do: b1b float, ff3, d3 4, microdash, ub3, ufn3, dash uf2 1+2 but the window to do this is somewhat tight. As soon as you see dvj fly up in the sky without doing any other moves - do b1b

Forsaken Soul: 4 2
DvJ does a mid-flight somersault mid kick and lands with a high backhand
Side step Right after blocking the somersalut then ub3 combo
If you cannot side step right duck the second hit then do ws4 combo
Note that you can also use RDS b3+4 Spin into RDS f3+4 3+4 after blocking the first hit


Cursed Starstorm: 421 uf hold
DvJ does a mid-flight somersault mid kick and an airborne mid followed by a lifting mid (on hit its a grab)
after the second hit launch him with ub3 or b1+2 (it is also possible to launch w b1+2 after the full string)


Devil Starstorm 4 2 on hit 1+2
Don't need to worry as if they hit there's nothing you can do this is just the start of cursed starstorm -  launch after the 42

Inner Turmouil 1+2
DvJ flies towards you with red energy crackling towards you and does an unblockable high.
3 answers: 
Harder to do: SSR AS SOON AS YOU SEE THE RED ENERGY!!!!
Easier to do: duck the 1+2 and do ws4 or uf3 - you can even stand up and do b1+2 or even ws2 hold
Technically possible to do d1+2 AOP d1+2 launcher after registering that it is dvj's 1+2 - but no need - too flashy and risky


Summarized Plan for yj:

Instead of trying to capitalise on uf1, 3 and uf1, 1  (with b1 ff3...) simply block instead as this makes it easier to punish the other moves. Punishing uf1, 3 comes at a later stage when I'm better at reacting and punishing. uf1, 1 requires a read on the opponent - it is not guaranteed because of the mixup of uf1, 2, 2.

Against uf1 / f3, 2, 2,         simply block everything and do ws4 combo
Against uf1 / f3, 4, 2          SSR after blocking somersault if can't SSR: duck then ws4
Against uf1 / f3, 421 uf      ub3 after blocking second hit or b1+2 after blocking 3rd hit
Against uf1 / f3, 1+2          SSR when hear crackling / see red aura : If can't SSR, duck then ws4 / uf3
