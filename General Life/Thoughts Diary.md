Cold, tired, don't want to move. not especially motivated. Pain in lots of pain. Why am I still ill??? And why do I get random embarassng memories lol.

07/01
Back hurts, at least got a bit of work done, there's a lot to think about though. Have to put social stuff on the backbench too much other stuff to focus on. Stressed about needing to go to group therapy tomorrow. Student loans is making me sad :( . Also upset because the monitoring software makes it next to impossible to access certain websites / online services. Also want to access social media which am currently not allowed to. Feels a little unfair esp. since I never used those social media in any kind of malicious way. Trying not to think about unfairness. Just have to accept things and move on. Am I even suitable for friendships? Right now, I'm low energy, constantly in pain and I simply just don't enjoy a lot of social events.

16/01

Often feel too many complex thoughts and tired to write down / think through.
Always feel tired and no energy
Feel like I need to do something more - something to balance out my life and be more productive but feel like I cant
Am doing social stuff but I don't feel like it's what I want but rather what I ought to do?
Need to be more productive on my game, am starting to get old and don't have anything to show for it.

20 - 22nd March

Stressed - need to complete crocheting gifts for friend's bday party but easily distracted by procrastination and friends etc. Very stressed, don't think am gonna make it on time

23rd March

Went to bday party of friend. Did not enjoy a lot, but did not hate. Attendance feels more like im doing just to support friend which I am happy to do but yeah. Was very loud and not the type of thing I would do normally.

24th, 25th March

Stress converted into whole body pain. Was extremely unwell. Did not feel ok physically, everything hurt and was tense. Feeling like not being able to be productive

26th

Group meeting - actually went somewhat ok, was able to speak somewhat more. Feeling stressed and annoyed at my lack of progress and my stress and paralysis even when it comes to small tasks.

27th

got some small tasks done, visited GP, booked appointments, did some calendar organisation etc. but they feel more like tasks I'm doing to avoid doing harder tasks maybe?

28th

Rest day due to doing a lot. Made a schedule for a 'free day'.


29th

Socialised with friend. Went well but keep thinking about wanting to do work but realizing that I am not productive right now and also at the same time not wanting to do work too.

30 - 31st 

Stressed, Want to work but just can't.
