NOTES: This below is what I would assume to be possible on a very good day for myself. It is not the optimal version of a day, but it is what I believe to be a somewhat realistic version of a good day scheduled for myself. That being said, it will be hard for me to follow this schedule strictly and as such in the future I will create some looser versions based off of this version of which will be easier to follow and I can swap to if I end up failing to follow this schedule for whatever reason. In an attempt to teach myself more self-love and patience with myself, I will promise to do my utmost best to be patient and loving towards myself and to try and not be overtly negative to myself if I cannot follow this schedule.

Addendum: Most likely I will procrastinate at some / multiple points in the day and watch youtube etc. this is OK as long as I acknowledge this and try to move on back to the task at hand before I got distracted. 

8 - 10am
- Wake up
- Get used to Chronic Pain
- Mindfulness Exercise
- Toiletries
- Mobile idle game (if can't get out of bed or if haven't finished dailies)
- (Bonus if manage to eat breakfast)
- Youtube Videos (Try to watch useful videos if possible)

10am - 12
- Breakfast and get settled in
- My friend may want to play Tekken: accept for now but come up w better time later (prefer evening as then it feels like a reward for doing good work and will be naturally tired)

12 - 1pm
- Lunch happens at some point around here (Try & finish all tasks in this section by 1pm)
- Attempt to stop playing w friend as early as possible:

- Prepare for working
	-> amend past goals and organisation
	-> determine goals to achieve for the day
	-> reorganize and structure in obsidian

- Check calendar and update anything that needs to be updated
	-> Check future events
	-> Check if any new events are to be added etc.


1pm to 3pm (ish - ending time can be anywhere from 3pm to 4pm)
- Work :
	-> This will most likely be developing my game but allow other projects such as writing etc.
	-> Try and focus as much as possible but allow oneself to get distracted every now and then (don't be too harsh on oneself)

3pm to 3.30pm
- Suggested Break time (don't have to take it now but have earned 1/2 an hour of uninterrupted break)
- Suggested to do daily missions on mobile idle game and leave running in background for the final mission (play for 60 mins)
- Can potentially take slightly longer game if my other friend wants to play a bit of Tekken (different friend from morning friend and doesn't play too much)

3.30pm to 4pm
- Begin work on a separate project than what was worked on earlier (30 min minimum) - this is to in theory refresh the mind and also allow myself to work on multiple projects: Recommend working on book but can also work on video editing or other projects

4pm to 6pm
- Work: Same as 1pm to 3pm
- At some point will have dinner

6pm to 8pm:
- Stream:
	-> Can stream Tekken 8 or coding
	-> Can potentially think about streaming other times too but try and be consistent with 6pm to 8pm

8pm to 10pm:
- Admin tasks (prepping for next day, amending calendar, obsidian, journal etc.)
- Free Time
- Can continue Streaming / working etc. but this is free time to be used at my disgression.


10pm onwards:
- Aim to sleep but it's ok if not: am a bit of a night owl and might have issues with revenge procrastination. The main thing is to be kind to oneself and take things slow.


Before Sleep:
- Small Stretch
- Bonus if can do small mindfulness video
